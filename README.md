# Basic Interpreter
Basic Interpreter Written in Rust

This project made during free times and for fun. The only purpose of the project is learning how to create an interpreter or a compiler. Due to limited time, this project is developing very slowly. But like I said, it is just a fun project after all.


# Build and Run
* Clone the Git repository.
* If you are not installed Rust compiler yet, you can download Rust from [here](https://www.rust-lang.org/).
* You need to create a file for sample test code in your project folder.
* Open your terminal in your project directory and run `cargo run [your-test-file-name]`.
